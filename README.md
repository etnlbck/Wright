Wright! Magazine

I'm putting here the sources of my Wright! Magazine & Game engine as backup and reference for curious people. You can play with it here: http://www.kesiev.com/wright

Since I've decided to implement from scratch the nicest things I learnt, thought, played and made in my past (and present, as much as I can), this project is going to be pretty __weird__. For example, it plays videogames coded in JSON and uses HTML DOM elements (aw, old good times) or HTML5 Canvas - both supporting full screen effects. Just because.
